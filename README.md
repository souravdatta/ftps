FTPS
==============

A simple FTP client that handles the server side time outs and reconnects automatically and cd's to the working directory you were before the timeout occurred. Supports basic FTP transfer commands. Requires Ruby to be installed and on your PATH. For the shell and batch scripts, edit ftps (or ftps.bat) and set FTPS_PATH to the localtion where this batch file along with the ruby file exists. Put ftps directory in PATH and make sure that all the files are in the same place.

Cheers!
